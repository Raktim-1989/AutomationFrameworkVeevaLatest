#############################
Understand Thread Safety Issues

My Test Scripts working fine when running sequentially but failing when ran in parallel. Have you faced this issue ? What is causing the issue ?
All local variables of primitive type are stored in Thread Stack itself and they are thread safe .//thread-safe
All local variables of non primitive types are stored on stack but the object itself is stored in heap .//thread-safe 
All Object's member variable is stored in heap along with the object itself (Primitive & Reference) . If the thread has access to the object, it has access to its members .
Static class variables are also stored in heap .//heap memory members are not thread-safe and thats why static class variables are not thread safe 

Fixing Parallel execution issues with Thread-Local

1. Thread Local class helps to create variables that can be read & written by the same thread .
2. Easiest way to safeguard static class variables .
3. Creating a Thread Local variable .
4. Default Value of a Thread Local variable .
5. Get , Set & Remove methods . 
6. Initial Thread Local Value (Optional).

   Creating Reusable Methods 
1. Sub Class IS A Super class (IS A Relationship is mandatory)
 
2. When the sub class needs most or all the methods of super class 
   Rule: Don't use inheritance for code reusability alone
    
3. Creating Base Page

4. Understanding problem with explicit wait usage 

################################
Enums 

1. Enums is a special Java types used to define collection of constants 
2. Enum can contain constants & methods etc
3. Enums in if condition
4. Enums in switch
5. Enums with instance variables 
6. values() , valueOf() , toString() methods 
7. Why Enum cannot extend another class
8. Storing Enum in EnumSet & EnumMap

Solving existing issue in explicit wait implementation with Enum
Creating a reusable method for handling waits 
Solving issue with the property file implementation with Enum

dataprovider

why we need dataprovider when we have for loop
Return type of dataprovider is not always Object[][]
How to use dataprovider 
How to use same dataprovider for multiple test methods 
when we will use dataprovider
data provider with excel
dataprovider with excel and hashmap to reduce the parameter in test method 
parallel = true attribute in DataProvider
Can we control dataprovider threadcount ? //yes in testng.xml - suite tag < data-provider-thread-count="3" >
Implementing data provider to run same test with multiple set of test data in parallel

################################
Listeners

IItestListeners
ISuiteListeners
IMethodInterceptor
IRetryAnalyzer
IAnnotationTranformer
what is the use of these listeners ?
Is re-running failed tests good practice ?

############################
Implementing Extent Reports

Creating Simple StandAlone Report in Extent Reports
Integrating with Framework
Using ThreadLocal to avoid Thread safety issues with Extent Report
Creating Custom Logger for extent reports
Why we need listeners to setup & Teardown the reports ?
Hiding the getExtentTest method from page layers 

Dynamic Reports
Screenshots as Base64 String
Screenshots as Passed, Failed & Skip tests -- Control from Property File
More customization

###########################
Custom Annotations 

How to add authors , groups into Extent Reports
What is the problem with this approach ?
What is Annotations ?
Can you give some implementations to understand Annotations ?
How to create your own Annotations ?
How to use it in framework ?

1) Annotations doesn't support inheritance
2) Creating instance for annotation using new keyword is not possible
3) It doesn't hold any methods or constructors 
4) Annotations can only declare attributes of primitive types , String , class, Enums , String[] , Class[] or Enum[]
